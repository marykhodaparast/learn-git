git init

touch README.md

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/something.git

git push -u origin master

-------------------------------------------------------Note---------------------------------------------------------------- 
1) for solving 403 error when pushing we should first say "git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/something.git"
2) if push rejected first we should pull and then push or write 
git push -f origin master

we use git add . to add all the files in our folder.
git log => we see our commits
git reset --hard (45ef5a2d5a3db8782c8e478afe31348bae6a70b9=this is number of commit when you run git log) => it deletes that commit and changes of that commit
git reset  (45ef5a2d5a3db8782c8e478afe31348bae6a70b9=this is number of commit when you run git log) => it deletes that commit but changes still exist
for example if we want to remove last commit, we should do git reset --hard {{ lastcommit }}
all folers and files are saved in .git file so if we want to remove them we can remove .git
by default we have a branch called master branch
using branches is done when we have some teams and for example team A work on branch 1 (they work frontEnd) and team B work on branch2 (they work backend)
in this example team A work on index.html
so we write git branch example and if we don't have .git first we write "git init to initialize"
git branch => we see the branches
if we write "git checkout exmple" then we are in the example branch not master
git branch --help => gives you information about branch
git branch -d example => it deletes branch example
git checkout -b newCategory => switched to branch newCategory
